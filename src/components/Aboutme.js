					In early 2022, I was accepted into my University's internship program.
					Sadly, I was not elligible to participate in one, due to being legally
					involved with out family business. Suddenly, I found myself with more
					time on my hands, as I was almost done with the University curriculum.{' '}
					<br></br>
					<br></br>I started learning how to code following the interest I
					already had and the urge of some friends who are already in the
					industtry. Soon enough, I knew that this was what I wanted to do for
					my career. <br></br>
					<br></br>I already had some knowledge about the subject, thanks my
					High School Computer Science professors who were excellent, and the
					classes about algorithms and Computer Science in my University
					curriculum. Between that knowledge, the very long hours I put in and
					the occasional help from my friends, I learned rather fast. I am now
					seeking an internship role where I can work alongside and learn from
					other developers.{' '}
